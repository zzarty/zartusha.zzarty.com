        <p>
          <strong>Payment Terms:</strong><br />
          I begin work on your commission only after receiving 50% of the total
          payment. The remaining 50% is due upon completion of the work.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Artistic Freedom:</strong><br />
          I enjoy having artistic freedom in my commissions and generally prefer
          not to work on highly specific or rigid requests.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Usage Rights:</strong><br />
          The work is intended for non-commercial use only. If you wish to use
          the artwork for merchandise such as buttons, posters, or other
          commercial products, this must be discussed and agreed upon in
          advance.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Credit & Social Media Sharing:</strong><br />
          You must credit me as the artist when displaying the work. I retain
          the right to post the artwork on my own social media and portfolios,
          unless otherwise agreed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Private Commissions:</strong><br />
          I do not accept private commissions by default, but we can discuss it
          if you have specific requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Refund Policy:</strong><br />
          Refunds will only be issued if I am unable to fulfill the commission
          due to unforeseen circumstances. In this case, the refund will be
          issued in full.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Revisions:</strong><br />
          Revisions are included in the cost of the commission but only before
          the final render is complete. Once the final render is done, revisions
          will be limited to post-processing adjustments.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Right to Decline:</strong><br />
          I reserve the right to decline any commission for any reason, at my
          discretion.
        </p>
